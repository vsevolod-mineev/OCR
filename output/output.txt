Abstract

We present PhoBERT with two versions of “base”
and “large”—the first public large-scale monolin-
gual language models pre-trained for Vietnamese.
We show that PhoBERT improves the state-of-
the-art in multiple Vietnamese-specific NLP tasks
including Part-of-speech tagging, Named-entity
recognition and Natural language inference. We
release PhoBERT to facilitate future research and
downstream applications for Vietnamese NLP. Our
PhoBERT is released at: https://github.
com/VinAIResearch/PhoBERT.

1 Introduction

Pre-trained language models, especially BERT—te Bidirec-
tional Encoder Representations from Transformers [Devlin
et al., 2019], have recently become extremely popular and
helped to produce significant improvement gains for various
NLP tasks. The success of pre-trained BERT and its variants
has largely been limited to the English language. For other
languages, one could retrain a language-specific model using
the BERT architecture [Vu er al., 2019; Martin et al., 2019;
de Vries et al., 2019] or employ existing pre-trained multi-
lingual BERT-based models [Devlin et al., 2019; Conneau et
al., 2019; Conneau and Lample, 2019].

In terms of Vietnamese language modeling, to the best of
our knowledge, there are two main concerns: (i) The Viet-
namese Wikipedia corpus is the only data used to train all
monolingual language models [Vu et al., 2019], and it also
is the only Vietnamese dataset included in the pre-training
data used by all multilingual language models except XLM-R
{Conneau et al., 2019]. It is worth noting that Wikipedia data
is not representative of a general language use, and the Viet-
namese Wikipedia data is relatively small (1GB in size un-
compressed), while pre-trained language models can be sig-
nificantly improved by using more data [Liu et al., 2019].
(ii) All monolingual and multilingual models, except ETNLP
[Vu et al., 2019], are not aware of the difference between
Vietnamese syllables and word tokens (this ambiguity comes
from the fact that the white space is also used to separate
syllables that constitute words when written in Vietnamese).
Without doing a pre-process step of Vietnamese word seg-
mentation, those models directly apply Bype-Pair encoding
(BPE) methods [Sennrich et al., 2016] to the syllable-level
pre-training Vietnamese data. Also, although performing

word segmentation before applying BPE on the Vietnamese
Wikipedia corpus, ETNLP in fact does not publicly release
any pre-trained BERT-based model.! As a result, we find dif-
ficulties in applying existing pre-trained language models for
word-level Vietnamese NLP tasks.

To handle the two concerns above, we train the first large-
scale monolingual BERT-based “base” and “large” models
using a 20GB word-level Vietnamese corpus. We evaluate
our models on three downstream Vietnamese NLP tasks: the
two most common ones of Part-of-speech (POS) tagging and
Named-entity recognition (NER), and a language understand-
ing task of Natural language inference (NLI). Experimental
results show that our models obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performances for all three tasks. We release our models under
the name PhoBERT in popular open-source libraries, hoping
that PhoBERT can serve as a strong baseline for future Viet-
namese NLP research and applications.

2 PhoBERT

This section outlines the architecture and describes the pre-
training data and optimization setup we use for PhoBERT.
Architecture: PhoBERT has two versions PhoBERTpase and
PhoBERT age, using the same configuration as BERT ase and
BERTharge, respectively. PhoBERT pre-training approach is
based on RoBERTa [Liu er al., 2019] which optimizes the
BERT pre-training method for more robust performance.
Data: We use a pre-training dataset of 20GB of uncom-
pressed texts after cleaning. This dataset is a combination of
two corpora: (i) the first one is the Vietnamese Wikipedia cor-
pus (~1GB), and (ii) the second corpus (~19GB) is a subset
of a 40GB Vietnamese news corpus after filtering out similar
news and duplications.? We employ RDRSegmenter [Nguyen
et al., 2018] from VnCoreNLP [Vu et al., 2018] to perform
word and sentence segmentation on the pre-training dataset,
resulting in ~145M word-segmented sentences (~3B word
tokens). Different from RoBERTa, we then apply fast BPE
[Sennrich et al., 2016] to segment these sentences with sub-
word units, using a vocabulary size of 64K subword types.
Optimization: We employ the RoBERTa implementation in
fairseg [Ott et al., 2019]. Each sentence contains at most
256 subword tokens (here, 5K/145M sentences with more

than 256 subword tokens are skipped). Following Liu et
al. [2019], we optimize the models using Adam [Kingma and
Ba, 2014]. We use a batch size of 1024 and a peak learn-
ing rate of 0.0004 for PhoBERT ase, and a batch size of 512
and a peak learning rate of 0.0002 for PhoBERThaye. We
run for 40 epochs (here, the leaming rate is warmed up for
2 epochs). We use 4 Nvidia V100 GPUs (16GB each), result-
ing in about 540K training steps for PhoBERT pase and 1.08M
steps for PhoBERT}ae. We pretrain PhoBERT ase during 3
weeks, and then PhoBERTharge during 5 weeks.

3 Experiments

We evaluate the performance of PhoBERT on three down-
stream Vietnamese NLP tasks: POS tagging, NER and NLI.
Experimental setup: For the two most common Vietnamese
POS tagging and NER tasks, we follow the VnCoreNLP setup
[Vu et al., 2018], using standard benchmarks of the VLSP
2013 POS tagging dataset and the VLSP 2016 NER dataset
[Nguyen et al., 2019a]. For NLI, we use the Vietnamese val-
idation and test sets from the XNLI corpus v1.0 [Conneau
et al., 2018] where the Vietnamese training data is machine-
translated from English. Unlike the 2013 POS tagging and
2016 NER datasets which provide the gold word segmenta-
tion, for NLI, we use RDRSegmenter to segment the text into
words before applying fast BPE to produce subwords from
word tokens.

Following Devlin et al. [2019], for POS tagging and NER,

we append a linear prediction layer on top of the PhoBERT
architecture w.r.t. the first subword token of each word. We
fine-tune PhoBERT for each task and each dataset indepen-
dently, employing the Hugging Face transformers for
POS tagging and NER and the RoBERTa implementation in
fairseg for NLI. We use AdamW [Loshchilov and Hutter,
2019] with a fixed learning rate of 1.e-5 and a batch size of
32. We fine-tune in 30 training epochs, evaluate the task per-
formance after each epoch on the validation set (here, early
stopping is applied when there is no improvement after 5 con-
tinuous epochs), and then select the best model to report the
final result on the test set.
Main results: Table 1 compares our PhoBERT scores with
the previous highest reported results, using the same exper-
imental setup. PhoBERT helps produce new SOTA results
for all the three tasks, where unsurprisingly PhoBERT\;.¢ ob-
tains higher performances than PhoBERT pace.

For POS tagging, PhoBERT obtains about 0.8% abso-
lute higher accuracy than the feature- and neural network-

based models VnCoreNLP-POS (i.e. VaMarMoT) and join-
tWPD. For NER, PhoBERTyage is 1.1 points higher F; than
PhoBERT},s: which is 2+ points higher than the feature-
and neural network-based models VnCoreNLP-NER and
BiLSTM-CNN-CRF trained with the BERT-based ETNLP
word embeddings [Vu et al., 2019]. For NLI, PhoBERT out-
performs the multilingual BERT and the BERT-based cross-
lingual model with a new translation language modeling ob-
jective XLMyim-+1M by large margins. PhoBERT also per-
forms slightly better than the cross-lingual model XLM-R,
but using far fewer parameters than XLM-R (base: 135M vs.
250M; large: 370M vs. 560M).

Discussion: Using more pre-training data can help signifi-
cantly improve the quality of the pre-trained language mod-
els [Liu e¢ al., 2019]. Thus it is not surprising that PhoBERT
helps produce better performance than ETNLP on NER, and
the multilingual BERT and XLMyim+tm on NLI (here,
PhoBERT employs 20GB of Vietnamese texts while those
models employ the 1GB Vietnamese Wikipedia data).

Our PhoBERT also does better than XLM-R which uses a
2.5TB pre-training corpus containing 137GB of Vietnamese
texts (Le. about 137/20 = 7 times bigger than our pre-
training corpus). Recall that PhoBERT performs segmenta-
tion into subword units after performing a Vietnamese word
segmentation, while XLM-R directly applies a BPE method
to the syllable-level pre-training Vietnamese data. Clearly,
word-level information plays a crucial role for the Viet-
namese language understanding task of NLI, i.e. word seg-
mentation is necessary to improve the NLI performance. This
reconfirms that dedicated language-specific models still out-
perform multilingual ones [Martin er al., 2019].

Experiments also show that using a straightforward fine-
tuning manner as we do can lead to SOTA results. Note that
we might boost our downstream task performances even fur-
ther by doing a more careful hyper-parameter fine-tuning.

4 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented the first public large-scale
PhoBERT language models for Vietnamese. We demonstrate
the usefulness of PhoBERT by producing new state-of-the-
art performances for three Vietnamese NLP tasks of POS
tagging, NER and NLI. By publicly releasing PhoBERT, we
hope that it can foster future research and applications in Viet-
namse NLP. Our PhoBERT and its usage are available at:
